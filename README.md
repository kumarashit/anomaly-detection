## Introduction

It is a reference implementation of intelligent monitoring which can utilize SODA Telemetry data, through exporters with Kafka (or similar) and a standard ML algorithm.

Any machine learning algorithm based on the use case can be integrated to this framework for specific data analysis and prediction.

This is one of the SODA Core Projects and is maintained by SODA Foundation directly. However there can be other SODA Compliant Anomaly Detection or intelligent telemetry projects from partners in future which can be part of SODA Foundation Project Landscape.
